Distribute BY with sort by: It is a kind of group by operation but works with sort by only  .

SELECT Dept,count(*) FROM employee Distribute BY DEPT;

SELECT Dept,count(*) FROM employee Distribute BY DEPT sort by Bankid ;[both grouping and sorting are running on the data]

Cluster By:

ClusterBy is a short-cut for both Distribute By and Sort By.
It ensures sorting orders of values present in multiple reducers 

For example, Cluster By clause mentioned on the Id column name of the table employees_guru table. 
             The output when executing this query will give results to multiple reducers at the back end. 
             But as front end it is an alternative clause for both Sort By and Distribute By.

This is actually back end process when we perform a query with sort by,
group by, and cluster by in terms of Map reduce framework.
So if we want to store results into multiple reducers, we go with Cluster By.
