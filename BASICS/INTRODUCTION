Hive is one of the component of hadoop buit on top of HDFS & is a data-warehouse 
kind of system in hadoop.Hive is mainly used for data summarization,querying of the data & for advanced querying.

Hive is exclusively meant for the processing of the data by the means of query meachanism of the data
managed as a part of the tabular format.Even though hive is managing the 
data in tabular format,the actual data is going to be stored on HDFS and processing of the data through querying is happening 
through MR in the backend.

As hive is not bundled in the default initialization of hadoop so we have to exclusively install hive on top of hadoop boxes.
Even though we are using SQL kind of queries as part of hive processing every hive query will be converted into corresponding MR job
i.e we can call hive processing as batch processing.
