Hive is one of the component of hadoop built on top of HDFS & is a data-warehouse kind of system in hadoop.
Hive is mainly used for data summarization,querying of the data & for advanced querying.

Hive is exclusively meant for the processing of the data by the means of query meachanism of the data managed as a part of the
tabular format.Even though hive is managing the data in tabular format,the actual data is going to be stored on HDFS and processing 
of the data through querying is happening through MR in the backend. i.e we can call hive processing as batch processing.
i.e we can call hive processing as batch processing.

As hive is not bundled in the default initialization of hadoop so we have to exclusively install hive on top of hadoop boxes.
