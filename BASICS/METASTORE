JAR file to be added in the lin file of hive directory : mysql-connector-java- 5.1.38. jar

METASTORE : It is the internal database of hive which is responsible for managing the metadata information in the hive table.
            i.e table name, column info, schema details, partition keys(if any), etc
            
            By default hive will come up with a derby database "Derby Database" as its embedded metastore , however we can also configure 
            some other externalk database  like mysql , ORACLE, SQLSERVER , DB2, etc as our hive database. 
   
Configure metastore in hive:

> Internal or local or embedded meta store (by default "derby")
> External or remote meta store [MYSQL/MS-SQL/ORACLE/DERBY]

metstore configuration will be a part of the 
$HIVE_HOME/conf/hive-site.xml file

below are the properties we nee dto add in the hive component
1. Driver class Details
2. Connection URL Details
3. Username Details
4. Password

Problem  with derby embedded metastore:

It is a single user metastore i.e if one user is already using hive & another user trying to access we will get 
the following error.
"Another instance of derby may have already booted to database /home/gopalkrishna/PRAC/Hive/Metastroe_db"
