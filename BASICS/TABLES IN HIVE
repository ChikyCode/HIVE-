Basically two type of table in Hive :
1. Managed Table 
2. External Table

Managed Table: Actually this are the default table of hive whose data will be managed by the hive warehouse system istelf,
               i.e without mentioning the location to stored on HDFS ,manage tabular data will by default get stored\
               in the default path of hive location.
               
               location : /user/hive/warehouse/<<dbname>>.db/<<tablename>> /<<data>>
               
               Syntax : create table <tablename> (Schema definition)
                        row format delimited
                        fields terminated by '<delimiter>'
                        lines terminated by '<delimiter>'
                        stored as <file format>;
               
               Two ways of Loading data in managed table :
                  
                        1. LOCAL MODE : load data local inpath '<local path>'  into table <tablename>
                        2. HDFS MODE  : load data inpath '<HDFS path>' into table <tablename>
                        
 External Table: As the name implies, these table are external to the hive warehouse path i.e external datapath will generally 
                 be stored in an external path of the hdfs other than hive dataware house path.
                        
                 Syntax : create external table <tablename> (Schema definition)
                          row format delimited
                          fields terminated by '<delimiter>'
                          lines terminated by '<delimiter>'
                          stored as <file format>;      [location : some HDFS path]
                          
                          loading of data will be same as managed table.
                   

When a managed table is dropped off :
> metadata will be lost from metastore.
> tabular data from HDFS will be lost. 
                        
When a external table is dropped off :
> metadata will be lost from metastore.
> However tabular data from external HDFS will not be lost it will be persistent.
