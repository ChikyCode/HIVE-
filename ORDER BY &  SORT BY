ORDER BY : Irrespective of the volume of the data ORDER BY clause will make use of single reducer 
to sort the data.
select * from <tablename> order by <column name>;

suppose we want to increase the number of reducer
        set mapred.reduce task='5';
But the number of the reducer in the compile  time is 1 
Order by never change the number of reducer.

SORT BY : where as SORT BY clause based on the volume of the data only respective number of reducer will be decided
select * from <tablename> sort by <column name>;

suppose we want to increase the number of reducer
        set mapred.reduce task='5';
But the number of the reducer is not specified.
5 reducer running but 1 reducer only running based on our data.

Note : Incase of large datas sets sorting SORTBY only preferable over ORDERBY with respect to performance.

Distribute BY with sort by: kinda of group by operation but works with sort by only  .

SELECT Dept,count(*) FROM employee Distribute BY DEPT;

SELECT Dept,count(*) FROM employee Distribute BY DEPT sort by Bankid ;[both grouping and sorting are running on the data]
