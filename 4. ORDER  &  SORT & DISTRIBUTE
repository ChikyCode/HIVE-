ORDER BY : Irrespective of the volume of the data ORDER BY clause will make use of single reducer 
to sort the data.
select * from <tablename> order by <column name>;

There are some limitations in the "order by" clause. In the strict mode (i.e., hive.mapred.mode=strict), 
the order by clause has to be followed by a "limit" clause. The limit clause is not necessary if you set hive.mapred.mode to 
nonstrict. The reason is that in order to impose total order of all results, there has to be one reducer to sort the final output. 
If the number of rows in the output is too large, the single reducer could take a very long time to finish.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SORT BY : where as SORT BY clause based on the volume of the data only respective number of reducer will be decided

select * from <tablename> sort by <column name>;

suppose we want to increase the number of reducer
        set mapred.reduce task='5';

But the number of the reducer is not specified.

5 reducer running but 1 reducer only running based on our data.

Note : Incase of large data sets sorting SORT BY only preferable over ORDER BY with respect to performance.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Group by:

Group by clause use columns on Hive tables for grouping particular column values mentioned with the group by. 
For whatever the column name we are defining a "groupby" clause 
the query will selects and display results by grouping the particular column values

ex : select area,count(*) from emp group by area;
     select area,sum(sal) from emp group by area; 
     
     
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Distribute BY with sort by: It is a kind of group by operation but works with sort by only  .

SELECT Dept,count(*) FROM employee Distribute BY DEPT;

SELECT Dept,count(*) FROM employee Distribute BY DEPT sort by Bankid ;[both grouping and sorting are running on the data]

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Cluster By:

ClusterBy is a short-cut for both Distribute By and Sort By.
It ensures sorting orders of values present in multiple reducers 

For example, Cluster By clause mentioned on the Id column name of the table employees_guru table. 
             The output when executing this query will give results to multiple reducers at the back end. 
             But as front end it is an alternative clause for both Sort By and Distribute By.

This is actually back end process when we perform a query with sort by,
group by, and cluster by in terms of Map reduce framework.
So if we want to store results into multiple reducers, we go with Cluster By.
