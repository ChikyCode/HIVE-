Windowing allows you to create a window on a set of data further allowing aggregation surrounding that data.
Windowing in Hive is introduced from Hive 0.11.


Windowing in Hive includes the following functions:

Lead : The number of rows to lead can optionally be specified. If the number of rows to lead is not specified, the lead is one row.
       Returns null when the lead for the current row extends beyond the end of the window.

Lag  : The number of rows to lag can optionally be specified. If the number of rows to lag is not specified, the lag is one row.
       Returns null when the lag for the current row extends before the beginning of the window.  

FIRST_VALUE : It returns the value of the first row from that window. 
			  With the below query, you can see the first row high price of the ticker for all the days.

LAST_VALUE  : It is the reverse of FIRST_VALUE. It returns the value of the last row from that window. 
			  With the below query, you can see the last row high price value of the ticker for all the days.
