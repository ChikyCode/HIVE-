It is one of the performance optimization technique along with partition.
Bucketing is used for "table sampling" purpose. [table sampling: selecting the range of data from the particular file]
As part of bucketing we are making use of cluster by class & internally using hashing algorithm to divide the data into 
key value pairs where 
                  Key :Bucket Number 
                  Value : Corresponding Data in each bucket.
                  
If we are not satisfied with partitioning becoz of less redundancy then we go with bucketing.

 1.  Table name : Basetab 
  
create table basetab(id int , name string , sal int , loc string)
row format delimited 
fields terminated by '|'
lines terminated by '\n'
stored as textfile;
  
load data local inpath '/home/gopalkrishna/Desktop/hive/input/empdata.log' into table basetab;

create table buckettab (id int ,name string, sal int, loc string)
clustered by (id) into 4 buckets
row format delimited 
fields terminated by '|'
lines terminated by '\n'
stored as textfile;

insert overwrite table buckettab select * from basetab;
                  
  2. Table name : B1
  
  create table B1 (id string,rep string,sal string,area string,year int)
  row format delimited 
  fields terminated by '|'
  stored as textfile;  
  
  load data inpath '/hive/sbacomplete.log' into table B1;
  
  create table B2 (id string,rep string,sal string,area string,year int)
  clustered by (year) into 4 buckets     [bucketing is done on an integer column]
  row format delimited 
  fields terminated by '|'
  stored as textfile;
  
  insert overwrite table B2 select * from B1;
  
  create table B2 (id string,rep string,sal string,area string,year int)
  clustered by (area) into 4 buckets      [bucketing is done on an string column]
  row format delimited 
  fields terminated by '|'
  stored as textfile;
  
  insert overwrite table B2 select * from B1;
  
  ---- If bucketing is done on integer then hashing will be normal
  ---- If bucketing is done on string then hashing will be like "it will take the ASCII value of all the charecter and add it up
  ---- & apply mod  function on it"
  
  ---- if we want to see any  particular bucket of a table then
  ---- select * from B2 TABLESAMPLE(bucket 2 out of 4);
