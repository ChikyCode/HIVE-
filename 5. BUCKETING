It is one of the performance optimization technique along with partition.
Bucketing is used for "table sampling" purpose. [table sampling: selecting the range of data from the particular file]
As part of bucketing we are making use of cluster by class & internally using hashing algorithm to divide the data into 
key value pairs where 
                  Key :Bucket Number 
                  Value : Corresponding Data in each bucket.
                  
If we are not satisfied with partitioning becoz of less redundancy then we go with bucketing.
                  Paritition : FOLDER LEVEL
                  Bucketing  : FILE LEVEL
 
 Partitioning : Follows flexible Schema | user have control
 Bucketing    : Follows Fixed Schema    | user have no control
 
 --------------- set hive.enforce.bucketing=true; [By default the above parameter value is false , set it to true for bucketing]
   
                  
  1. Bucketing based on integer value [If bucketing is done on integer then hashing will be normal]
  Table name : B1
  
  create table B1 (id string,rep string,sal string,area string,year int)
  row format delimited 
  fields terminated by '|'
  stored as textfile;  
  
  load data inpath '/hive/sbacomplete.log' into table B1;
  
  create table B2 (id string,rep string,sal string,area string,year int)
  clustered by (year) into 4 buckets      
  row format delimited 
  fields terminated by '|'
  stored as textfile;
  
  insert overwrite table B2 select * from B1;
  
  2. Bucketing based on charecter value [If bucketing is done on string then hashing will be like "it will take the ASCII value of all the charecter and add it up
     & apply mod  function on it"]
     Table name : B1
  
  create table B1 (id string,rep string,sal string,area string,year int)
  row format delimited 
  fields terminated by '|'
  stored as textfile;  
  
  load data inpath '/hive/sbacomplete.log' into table B1;
  
  create table B2 (id string,rep string,sal string,area string,year int)
  clustered by (area) into 4 buckets      
  row format delimited 
  fields terminated by '|'
  stored as textfile;
  
  insert overwrite table B2 select * from B1;
 
 ----- if we want to see any  particular bucket of a table then
 ----- select * from B2 TABLESAMPLE(bucket 2 out of 4);
  
  3. Partitioning with bucketing
  
  create table sbacopy (id string,rep string,sal string,area string,year int)
  row format delimited 
  fields terminated by '|'
  stored as textfile;  
  
  load data local inpath '/home/gopalkrishna/Desktop/hive/input/sba/sbacomplete.log' into table partbucket;
  
 create table partbucket(id string, rep string, sal string,year int)
 partitioned by (area string)
 clustered by (year) into 3 buckets
 row format delimited 
 fields terminated by '|'
 stored as textfile;
  
 insert overwrite table partbucket partition(area) select id, rep, sal, year,area from sbacopy;
